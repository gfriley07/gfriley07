## :wave: About Me
I’m a **Technical Support Engineer (Tier 2)** at [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) with over **5 years** of hands-on experience in **Salesforce Administration**, **IT Operations**, and **Cloud Services**. I love diving into **debug logs**, **Flow automations**, and **SOQL** queries to resolve complex issues, while enhancing operational efficiency. Outside of work, I’m a graduate student pursuing my **Master’s in Data Science** at the University of Pittsburgh, where I plan to merge data-driven insights with my Salesforce expertise.

## :dragon_face: Other Interests
**Dungeon & Dragons 5e (and beyond):**  
- I’m a **Dungeon Master** and player, enthralled by weaving imaginative stories and strategic gameplay.  
- D&D has also sharpened my communication skills—explaining complex “rules as written” is surprisingly similar to breaking down technical docs for non-technical audiences!

**Tinkering With Tech**  
- Learning new platforms/tools (hello Git and GitHub!)  
- Creating automation scripts in Python or PowerShell  
- Always looking for ways to optimize tasks, whether it’s a D&D campaign or a complex workflow in Salesforce
